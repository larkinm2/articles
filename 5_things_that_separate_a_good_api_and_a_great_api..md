#5 things that separate a good API from a great API.

Whether it be offering developers a way to use its product or finding an easy way to exchange data, it seems like every innovative tech company offers an API.

A company can drastically increase its value by offering an easy to use API.Why? Because when developers want to use your product, they can be your most loyal companion…when they don’t they can sever a partnership.

But how do you make developers want to use your product? Here are 5 things that separate a good API from a great one. 


##5. Helpful Errors

Assisting the developers using your API should be a company’s top priority. Invalid requests from a user or even a server side error MUST be displayed in the API’s response

Experienced and inexperienced developers alike express frustration with the lack of errors an API provides. Imagine trying to fix a car without being able to look under the hood.

Ideally errors should be displayed the same way (JSON or XML) you would receive the data response. Some of the best RESTful APi’s proudly display basic 404 or 500 errors that help developers either fix their errors or include a query they might have missed in the request.

There are plenty of APIs on the market offering similar products. The last thing a company want to do is give developers a reason to work with its competitor. 




##4. Developer Community/API Blogs

A dedicated community blog can sometimes be more useful than documentation. Most APIs are not used in ways companies can not anticipate when writing documentation. I am still amazed at the innovative ways customers use Trustpilot’s API. 

I once helped a friend make a voice activated to-do list using a combination of Google Now and Trello’s API. Trello’s support team could not have anticpiated this particular use case, but thanks to Trello’s blog, we were able to talk with someone who already built something similar.

Imagine the power of harnessing the experiences of other developers using your API. Real people, actually using your API, in real applications can be much more helpful than documentation on the way a company thought you would use the API. 

And it’s easy to implement. All it takes is a simple blog or forum linked to your documentation.



##3. Updates and Changes

Trustpilot’s customers certainly know the importance of leveraging customer feedback to improve your product. A company should developer's feedback to imrove its API. 

But how can we do this? Hackathons!

Seeing developers use your api first hand, and watching them succeed and struggle is the best way to make your API better. Maybe one particular part of your documentation confuses new developers? Maybe everything goes smoothly until one particular API call? It would be impossible to know this type of information without watching developers use your API. 

If this is not in your budget, you can always ask your customer facing employees where clients typically have problems. Or you can setup a feedback email in your documentation.


##2. Documentation - "The Docs"

Developers most valuable asset is time. If you can save a developer an hour off of his/hers day, it definitely makes them want to come back and use the API again.

But how do we do this? Interactive documentation with deep filtering features saves developers an enormous amount of time. Specific filtering parameters built into the call can also help narrow down some of the requested data. 

Facebook’s graph API does this really well. Users can type in the information they are looking for and are instantly shown results of the data, with the necessary code to access it quickly. All of this is done on Facebook’s webpage before you write a line of code. Developers can get it up and running in a matter of minutes.

If interactive documentation is not available, then simplified api documentation is a nice alternative. Most developers want to get to the "nuts and bolts" of the request they need to make, without spending time learning about the company and all of its products. A simple base url with the necessary parameters is all that is needed in most cases. 


##1. Customer/Client Support

Customer and client support is by far the most important attribute that separates good API’s from great ones. The ability to speak with an actual person either over the phone or through email about specific issues in your application can make a huge difference. Imagine pair-programming with someone that uses an API on a daily basis. 

As great as automation and documentation can be, working in tech is not an excuse to avoid making personal connections with clients. Great evangelists and support agents know that having empathy for their clients issues can make the difference between a life-long user and a one time user. 

Web development can be frustrating when you're trying to use something for the first time. Having a real person in your corner to help you through some of the frustration can make all of the difference...the kind of difference that can separate a good API from a great one.
