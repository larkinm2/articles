#5 things that separate a good API and a great API.


###5. Helpful Errors

Being able to read through your errors is key to becoming a good developer. Often times it's how developers know to take the next stop. Invalid requests from a user or even a server side error HAS TO be displayed in the response of the API. 

I can not tell you how many times I have heard new and old developers express frustration with the lack of errors an API provides. There are plenty of APIs on the market that do similar things, so you do not want to give developers an excuse your competitions product. Ideally errors should be displayed the same way (JSON or XML) you would receive the data response. Some of the best RESTful APi’s proudly display basic 404 or 500 errors that help developers either fix their errors or include a query they might have missed in the request.

###4. Developer Community/API Blogs

A dedicated community blog can sometimes be more useful than documentation when it comes to API support. I find that some API’s, like Trello, are not used in the way the company originally designed. I once helped a friend make a voice activated to-do list using a combination of Google Now and Trello’s API. There is no way Trello’s support team would write specific documentation on this, but thanks to an external blog we were able to figure it out. 

Imagine the power of harnessing other developers experiences to benefit the users of your API. Real people, actually using your API, in real applications can be much more helpful than documentation on the way you SHOULD be using an API. All it takes is a simple blog or forum linked to your documentation to get this done, however so many companies fail to do this.

###3. Updates and Changes

Any great product has to shift or change depending on customer feedback. If an ingredient in a product you provides gives everyone a rash or makes everyone sick then you have to take it out and replace it with something else. 

API’s are the same way. If something is hindering your users from accessing your data properly then you have to make the changes to fix it. This also means providing your users with  an outlet to express their concerns.

Some companies might say providing a complaint box or support email is enough, but great evangelists/advocates know better. The second a user signs up for an access key they should be provided with an outlet for support/complaints. More on this later…

###2. Documentation - "The Docs"

I believe that a developers most precious asset is time. If you can save a developer an hour off of his/hers day, it definitely makes them want to come back and use the API again and again.
 
Interactive documentation with deep filtering features saves developers an enormous amount of time. 

Facebook’s graph API does this really well. Users can type in the information they are looking for and are instantly shown results of the data, with the necessary code to access it quickly. All of this is done on Facebook’s webpage before you write a line of doe. Developers can get it up and running in a matter of minutes. Other great examples include any site with a developer dashboard like Return Path or Mezzobit. 

###1. Customer/Client Support

This is by far the most important thing that separates great API’s from good ones. The ability to talk with a person either over the phone or through email about specific issues in YOUR application can make a huge difference. 

Working in tech is not an excuse to avoid personal connections with clients. Great evangelists and advocates know that having empathy for their clients issues with their API can make the difference between a life-long user and a one time user. Development can be frustrating and difficult at times when trying to use something for the first time. Having a real person in your corner to help you through some of the frustration can make all of the difference. 

Great API’s live and die with user support.
