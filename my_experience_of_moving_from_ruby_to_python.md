#My experience of moving from Ruby to Python

Ruby is a beautiful web language. But what about data analysis? I gathered a bunch of baseball data and I attempted to analyze it. Keep in mind I have only been using Python for less than a week.

###Initial problems
Syntax! Everytime I learn a new language the syntax absolutely kills the first day. Maybe it has to do with the muscle memory of coding for hundreds of hours a certain way, or maybe I am just adjust to syntax a little bit slower than everyone else. Here are some takeways about Python syntax. 

1. indenting: This is huge in python. Your code won't work without proper indentation. 
2. semi-colons: Like many programming languages, semi-colons are required. It seems easy to remember until you forget it.  

###Package Management
After you install Python and order the "Dive into Python" book from Amazon, the next thing you have to worry about is Python management. 

In Ruby, gems are the easy way to install standard third-party libraries. In python, there is a few ways to do this. (easy-install or pip). 

I friend of mine recommended i start with pip. 


###My final thughts

Python’s is great for functional programming. We can create pure functions without much effort and pass them like any other variable.
But you can’t always use your functions with Python’s libraries.

Why not? Because a lot of Python’s libraries are built out of objects, and Python doesn’t let us combine our favorite functions with object methods.

Now, we definitely can deal with objects in Python without resorting to loops and if statements, but we do have to abandon standard techniques for that. 

I’m not especially happy about the extra effort. Should we really have to delete our favorite functions just because we want to call a method instead of a function?`

More to come...
